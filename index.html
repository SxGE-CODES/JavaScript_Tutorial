ASYNC & AWAIT JAVASCRIPT:
The Async function is waiting for the Await function to complete it's task before running.
We make use of the Async function.

The TRY and CATCH Methods:
TRY Method: Helps us to specify what kind of function we want to run whever we perform a singular or particular action or whenever our code returns a value. 
CATCH Method: Enables us to specify the actions that we want to perform when there's an error during the server response.

Request Message is when the Browser takes your Request to the Back-end.

Await Function is the Function that the Async function waits for to run before it runs.

What is Git?
- Git is a technology that provides us with some commands that helps us to back-up our code to Git.
- We can use it to create different versions of our code.

REPOSITORY: This is a place where we keep our files. Remote Repository is a place online where you can back-up your code e.g. Google Drive. 
Local Repository: are the folders on your Local Machine.  

Where or what is GitHub?
- GitHub is a platform where you can back-up your code online and contribute to open source projects.
- Programers of different location can work on a project without having to meet each other.

RELATIONSHIP BTW GIT AND GITHUB:
GitHub is a place where we can back-up our code. While Git helps us with the Necessary actions to doing things on GitHub.

Git Remote add is a command that we use to add a bridge connection btw our local and remote repository.
Branch is where your app is coming from if you want to create a page for.
Git Branch here you specify where you want you code to be located
Main and Origin Branch.
Git Push:


.gitignore files are used to store files that you don't want to be uploaded to GitHub, they can be files containing your credentials for back-end that you don't want to be public 
git init is what we used to initialize git. we use it to initialize a git repository.
